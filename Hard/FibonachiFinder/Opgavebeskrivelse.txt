Creat a program that finds the nth fibonachi number using recursion.
Example:
The 7th fibonachi number is 13 (assuming 0 is not part of the sequence)

The next number in the fibonachi sequence is found by adding the last two numbers. So to find the 8th number
the 6th and 7th numbers are added up. Ie. 8 + 13 = 21.
